### Welcome to my GitHub Profile!


  Welcome to my github profile. My name is Quentin Jones and I am a software engineer here in Florida, US. This github page houses the majority of my work and I am glad   that you have taken an interest in seeing some of the outcomes of my undertakings. 

  This page is still a work in progress as I am working on new ideas and projects all of the time. I engineer and develop for myself, but also to help others acheive       their goals. I like to think of coding as a team sport and hope to be able to collaborate more to further my learning and possibly impart knowledge that I have           attained as well. Working as a part of a team is always rewarding.

  Coding is a great passion of mine, but I am also passionate about real estate and traveling. I am hoping that these interests will keep fueling one another as they have in the past. I just want to say welcome again and thank you for taking a look at my page! If you are so inclined, you can contact me using my socials below!
  
  If you see something you like, please feel free to put a star on the repository!
